  <Scene Graph Description>
  A 3D scene graph is a hierarchical graph consisting of layers that each contain nodes. Graphs have the 2D Places layer, the 3D Places layer, the Objects layer, and the Rooms layer.
  3D Places Layer (PLACES): The 3D Places layer in the scene graph contains places that are reachable locations in the world. Each Place node has a unique ID (p<id>). Note that the unique ID uses a lowercase 'p' for the 3D Places layer.
  2D Places Layer (MESH_PLACES): The 2D Places layer contains Places that are reachable locations in the world with a possible semantic class (type). Each Place node has a unique ID (P<id>). Note that the unique ID uses an uppercase 'P' for the 2D Places layer.
  Objects Layer (OBJECTS): The Objects layer contains Objects that exist in the world. Each Object has a unique ID (O<id>), a semantic class (type), an x,y position (pos), and a parent. The parent can be a place or a room, indicating which place or room the Object belongs to. Each Object will be represented in the form: (id, type, pose, parent_room).
  Rooms Layer (ROOMS): The Rooms Layer contains Rooms that exist in the world. Each Room has a unique ID (R<id>) and a semantic class (type). Each Room will be represented in the form: (R<id>, type).
  A graph can have either a 2D Places Layer, or a 3D Places Layer, or both. Rooms are at the top level of the hierarchy, Places (2D and 3D) are below Rooms, and Objects are below Places. To get an Object in a Room, you must look at the Places in that Room first.
