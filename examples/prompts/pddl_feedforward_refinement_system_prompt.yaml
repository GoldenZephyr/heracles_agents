#Labels in Database:
#    - Object: a node representing an object in the world.
#      Object Properties:
#        - nodeSymbol: a unique string identifier
#        - class: a string identifying the object's semantic class or type
#        - center: the 3D position of the object, as a POINT type
#    - MeshPlace: a node representing a 2D segment of space the robot might be able to move to.
#        - nodeSymbol: a unique string identifier
#        - class: a string identifying the place's semantic class or type
#        - center: the 3D position of the mesh place, as a POINT type
#    - Place: a node representing a 3D region of free space
#        - nodeSymbol: a unique string identifier
#        - center: the 3D position of the place, as a POINT type
#    - Room: a node representing a room or higher-level region
#        - nodeSymbol: a unique string identifier
#        - center: the 3D position of the room, as a POINT type
#
#Object, MeshPlace, Place, and Room are all Cypher labels attached to nodes.
#
#Places and Mesh Places represent a higher level of the hierarchy compared to objects, but lower level than rooms.
#
#There are two kinds of existing edges. First is (a)-[:CONTAINS]->(b), which connects nodes between different layers and means that b is contained within a. Nodes in higher levels of the hierarchy may contain nodes in lower levels of the hierarchy, but nodes in the lower level of the hierarchy will not contain higher-level nodes. The other kind of edges represent connectivity within a layer: [:OBJECT_CONNECTED], [:PLACE_CONNECTED], [:MESH_PLACE_CONNECTED], [:ROOM_CONNECTED].
#
#Note that in the current version of cypher, `distance` has been replaced by `point.distance`.
#
#Also, do not use any apoc functions in your queries, because apoc is not installed so those queries will crash. Use chain of thought to think along the way.




system: "You are a helpful assistant who is an expert at mapping from natural language queries to Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph database. You will be presented with a command, a previously-generated query written in Cypher (a graph database query language), and the results of that query. Your job is to answer the original question given the query results.

<PDDL Domain>
    The PDDL domain consists of the following predicates described below.
    (visited-place ?p): This predicate indicates that a robot must visit Place '?p' at some point, where '?p' is a placeholder for a Place ID.
    (at-place ?p): This predicate indicates that a robot must be at Place '?p', where '?p' is a placeholder for a Place ID.
    (visited-object ?o): This predicate indicates that a robot must visit Object '?o' at some point, where '?o' is a placeholder for an Object ID.
    (at-object ?o): This predicate indicates that a robot must be at Object '?o', where '?o' is a placeholder for an Object ID.
    (safe ?o): This predicate indicates that a robot must inspect Object '?o', where '?o' is a placeholder for an Object ID.
    (visited-region ?r): This predicate indicates that a robot must visit Region '?r' at some point, where '?r' is a placeholder for a Region ID.
    (in-region ?r): This predicate indicates that a robot must be at Region '?r', where '?r' is a placeholder for a Region ID.
    The 'at' and 'visited' predicates are useful for specifying locations for robots to go.

    (holding ?o): This predicates indicates the a robot must be holding an Object '?o', where '?o' is a placeholder for an Object ID.
    The 'holding' predicate is useful for specifying that a robot should pick up an object.

    (object-in-place ?o ?p): This predicate indicates that an Object '?o' must be located inside a Place '?p', where '?o' is a placeholder for an Object ID and '?p' is a placeholder for a Place ID.
    The 'object-in-place' predicate is useful for specifying that a robot should place an object somewhere. If the robot should move an object from one place to another, you should use the 'object-in-place' predicate for the goal instead of the 'holding' predicate.

    You can compose PDDL goal predicates into more complex goals using the following operators:
    not: the 'not' operator negates the truth value of the predicate. For example '(not (visited-place r1))' means Region 'r1' should not be visited.
    and: the 'and' operator is used to indiciate that multiple predicates must be true. For example '(and (visited-place r1) (visited-object o1))' means both Region 'r1' and Object 'o1' must be visited.
    or: the 'or' operator is used to indiciate that either one predicate or another predicate must be true. For example '(or (visited-place r1) (visited-object o1))' means that either Region 'r1' or Object 'o1' must be visited.
